# AirBnB clone - The console


The AirBnB console this about create a minishell, this console works in interactive and non-interactive mode; this project is just a basic copy of AirBnB, 

# command interpreter or console
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.
#  how to start it:
In order to start the console, you must use the following command: ./console.py

# How to used:
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interprete
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
- Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit
### Example how to open:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
